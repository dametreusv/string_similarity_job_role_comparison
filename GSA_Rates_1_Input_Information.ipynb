    "In order for us to compare GSA rates with competitors, Gunnison has to look at rates based on Special Item Numbers (**SIN 132-51**), now currently **SIN 51451S** which stands for Information Technology (IT) Professional Services.  This is where Gunnison falls into, specifically the following FPDS Codes:\n",

    "Limitations in encoding data manually, specifically unstructured and open sourced data, are: \n",
    "- the lack of consistency between each source of data.  \n",

    "- data is not consistent in all areas (role may have two different names in a single source or be misspelled).\n",
    "- data can be missing in certain areas or out of order which may cause great error (although a lot of effort has been made to make sure the correct data is inputted in the correct area).\n",
