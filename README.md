# string_similarity_job_role_comparison

This repository outlines the steps taken to pull similar job roles from govt contractors on the GSA website.  The roles are then subjected to NLP/String Similarity in order to match roles based on job description and compare their hourly rates in order to adjust RFP rates and create a baseline for new hire salaries.

The result showed a normal distribution of roles with very rare similarities in job descriptions with the exception of a few outliers; which is what we were hoping for.  We wanted only 1-10 roles to have a match of 50% or more and 1-3 roles with a match of 80% or more in their job descriptions.
